I am post doctoral research fellow at the University of Edinburgh working in machine learning and statistical modelling of single cell genomics. My aim is to pursue cross-disciplinary research in the intersection of data science and biomedicine.

I am working with [Yanick Crow](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/crow-research-group). I did my `PhD` at the Cancer Research Centre (University of Edinburgh) under the supervision of [Kathryn Ball](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/kathryn-ball).
