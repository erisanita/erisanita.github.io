   Abstract={The neuroprotective E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP is linked to healthy aging. Here, we present a protocol using a patient-derived iPSC line with a triplication of the α-synuclein gene to produce gene-edited cells isogenic for CHIP. We describe iPSC differentiation into cortical neurons and their identity validation. We then detail mass spectrometry-based approaches (SWATH-MS) to identify dominant changes in the steady state proteome generated by loss of CHIP function. This protocol can be adapted to other proteins that impact proteostasis in neurons. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Dias et al. (2021).},

   Abstract={Better understanding of GBM signalling networks in-vivo would help develop more physiologically relevant ex vivo models to support therapeutic discovery. A "functional proteomics" screen was undertaken to measure the specific activity of a set of protein kinases in a two-step cell-free biochemical assay to define dominant kinase activities to identify potentially novel drug targets that may have been overlooked in studies interrogating GBM-derived cell lines. A dominant kinase activity derived from the tumour tissue, but not patient-derived GBM stem-like cell lines, was Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). We demonstrate that BTK is expressed in more than one cell type within GBM tissue; SOX2-positive cells, CD163-positive cells, CD68-positive cells, and an unidentified cell population which is SOX2-negative CD163-negative and/or CD68-negative. The data provide a strategy to better mimic GBM tissue ex vivo by reconstituting more physiologically heterogeneous cell co-culture models including BTK-positive/negative cancer and immune cells. These data also have implications for the design and/or interpretation of emerging clinical trials using BTK inhibitors because BTK expression within GBM tissue was linked to longer patient survival.},

   Abstract={CHIP is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that contributes to healthy aging and has been characterized as neuroprotective. To elucidate dominant CHIP-dependent changes in protein steady-state levels in a patient-derived human neuronal model, CHIP function was ablated using gene-editing and an unbiased proteomic analysis conducted to compare knock-out and wild-type isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Rather than a broad effect on protein homeostasis, loss of CHIP function impacted on a focused cohort of proteins from actin cytoskeleton signaling and membrane integrity networks. In support of the proteomics, CHIP knockout cells had enhanced sensitivity to induced membrane damage. We conclude that the major readout of CHIP function in cortical neurons derived from iPSC of a patient with elevate α-synuclein, Parkinson's disease and dementia, is the modulation of substrates involved in maintaining cellular "health". Thus, regulation of the actin cytoskeletal and membrane integrity likely contributes to the neuroprotective function(s) of CHIP.},

abstract = {Constitutive expression of interferons (IFNs) and their downstream signalling pathways plays a critical role in host responses to cell transformation in the tumour microenvironment. Induction of IFNs initiates the transcription of a variety of genes, so called IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Although expression of ISGs is classically associated with tumour suppression, a subset defined as the IRDS (Interferon Related DNA Damage Resistance Signature), is elevated in response to endogenous IFN, self-DNA, and RNA exposure in the tumour microenvironment. The IRDS is associated with intrinsic and acquired radiation and chemotherapy resistance. Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) are IFN regulated receptors that are thought to participate in proliferative signalling and therapy resistance. Phenotypic analysis conducted in this thesis showed the presence of both IFITM1 and IFITM3 in cancer cells and established that loss of IFITM function impacted growth rate and cell cycle progression as well as treatment sensitivity. To understand the mechanism of action of these genes, a panel of patient derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) was generated and manipulated using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene-editing. Using this approach, in conjunction with patient tissue analysis, signalling under basal as well as IFN-activated conditions was studied in the context of GSC status. Immunohistopathology of a glioma tissue micro-array identified an increased expression of IFITMs around the blood vessels as well as co-expression of IFITMs with Sox2, suggesting that IFITM positive cells are in the stem cell niche. By using wild-type and gene-edited GSCs to focus on the relationship between IFITM1 and IFITM3, compelling phenotypic and molecular evidence is provided on the IFN-induced localisation of IFITMs in structures involved in maintaining cell integrity. Additionally, this thesis shows that the status of IFITMs expression impacts their localisation, shuttling them from the cytoplasm/membrane to the perinuclear structures. As such, taking into consideration the constitutive expression of interferons in the tumour microenvironment, this study provides evidence that IFITMs can potentially regulate glioma stem cell self-renewal. Targeting their localisation may be a potential mechanism to this quiescent population which can escape chemotherapy.},
